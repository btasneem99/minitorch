MiniTorch is a diy teaching library for machine learning engineers who wish to learn about the internal concepts underlying deep learning systems. It is a pure Python re-implementation of the Torch API designed to be simple, easy-to-read, tested, and incremental. The final library can run Torch code.

The following topics are covered in each module:
Module 0 - ML Programming Foundations
Module 1 - Autodifferentiation
Module 2 - Tensors
Module 3 - GPUs and Parallel Programming
Module 4 - Foundational Deep Learning
